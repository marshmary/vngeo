# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-09-21
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Web application showing the map of Vietnam highlighting six different economic zones with zone details, Q&A functionality, and document management

**Session Goals:** Focused ideation for a high school student-targeted front-end application with minimal backend but data editing capabilities

**Techniques Used:** Analogical Thinking

**Total Ideas Generated:** 3 core analogies

### Key Themes Identified:
- Educational focus for high school students
- Visual map-based interface inspiration
- Administrative document management capabilities
- Front-end focused architecture with data editing needs

## Technique Sessions

### Analogical Thinking - 10 minutes

**Description:** Finding parallels and analogies to inspire ideas for the Vietnam economic zones application

#### Ideas Generated:
1. A geology showcase for high school students
2. IDC map design approach (from Behance reference)
3. A platform where web administrators can upload documents for students

#### Insights Discovered:
- Educational component is central to the application purpose
- Visual design inspiration can drive user interface decisions
- Content management functionality is needed alongside informational display
- The combination of educational content and administrative tools creates unique requirements

#### Notable Connections:
- All analogies center around educational delivery to high school students
- Visual presentation and content management are recurring themes
- The need to balance student-facing features with administrative functionality

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Interactive Map Interface**
   - Description: Implement clickable Vietnam map showing six economic zones using design inspiration from IDC reference
   - Why immediate: Clear visual requirement with existing design reference
   - Resources needed: Front-end mapping library, Vietnam geographic data, zone boundary definitions

2. **Static Information Display**
   - Description: Create detailed zone information pages accessible via map clicks
   - Why immediate: Straightforward content display with no complex backend requirements
   - Resources needed: Content research, responsive design framework, economic zone data compilation

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **Document Management System**
   - Description: Allow administrators to upload and manage educational documents for each zone
   - Development needed: File upload functionality, storage solution, user permission system
   - Timeline estimate: 2-3 weeks for basic implementation

2. **Q&A Interactive System**
   - Description: Tab-based question and answer functionality for each economic zone
   - Development needed: Content management for Q&A pairs, search functionality, categorization system
   - Timeline estimate: 1-2 weeks for static implementation

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **Geology Integration Platform**
   - Description: Expand beyond economic zones to include comprehensive geological education about Vietnam
   - Transformative potential: Could become comprehensive Vietnamese geography education tool
   - Challenges to overcome: Massive content requirements, expert validation, curriculum alignment

### Insights & Learnings
- **Educational Focus**: The application serves dual purposes - informational display for students and content management for administrators
- **Front-end Constraints**: The requirement for minimal backend while supporting data editing creates interesting technical challenges
- **Visual Design Priority**: The reference to specific design inspiration suggests visual presentation is crucial for user engagement

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Interactive Map Interface
- Rationale: Core functionality that defines the entire application experience
- Next steps: Research front-end mapping libraries compatible with Vietnam geographic data
- Resources needed: Mapping library selection, Vietnam boundary data, economic zone definitions
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks for basic implementation

#### #2 Priority: Zone Information Display System
- Rationale: Essential content delivery mechanism for educational objectives
- Next steps: Research and compile economic zone information, design responsive layout
- Resources needed: Economic zone data research, front-end framework, responsive design patterns
- Timeline: 1 week for content preparation, 1 week for implementation

#### #3 Priority: Document Management Foundation
- Rationale: Addresses administrative requirements while maintaining front-end focus
- Next steps: Explore front-end file handling options, local storage solutions
- Resources needed: Research client-side storage options, file handling libraries
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks for research and basic implementation

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Analogical thinking helped clarify the educational nature of the application
- Reference to existing design provided concrete visual direction
- Session quickly identified core functional requirements

### Areas for Further Exploration
- Technical implementation: How to achieve data editing with minimal backend
- User experience design: Balancing student and administrator interfaces
- Content strategy: Determining specific information architecture for economic zones

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- SCAMPER Method: To explore technical implementation alternatives
- Resource Constraints: To work within front-end limitations creatively
- Role Playing: To understand different user perspective requirements

### Questions That Emerged
- How will data persistence work with minimal backend requirements?
- What specific economic zone information is most valuable for high school students?
- How can administrative features be integrated without compromising student experience?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:** Technical architecture decisions, user interface design specifics, content strategy development
- **Recommended timeframe:** Within 1 week to maintain momentum
- **Preparation needed:** Research front-end mapping libraries, gather sample economic zone content, review similar educational applications
